Title: FlickOS: Userbase and Status
Date: 2023-03-13
Category: operating system

I am happy to report that [FlickOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flickos/) project in sourceforge.net is gaining tractions since I make it publicly available last March 9 of this year. Just four days after it's debut, FlickOS already saved 15 computers from going to the dumpsite. Thank you all for those who downloaded FlickOS and please share to your friends and families so we can save more computers.
