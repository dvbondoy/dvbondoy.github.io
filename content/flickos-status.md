I am happy to report that [FlickOS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flickos/) project in sourceforge.net is gaining tractions since I make it publicly available last March 9 of this year. Just four days after it's debut, FlickOS already saved 15 computers from going to the dumpsite. Thank you all for those who downloaded FlickOS and please share to your friends and families so we can save more computers.

Current development status of FlickOS is at full speed. I created a utility program called "layout-switcher" for quick desktop layout switching. Currently available layouts are Classic (windows like layout), Elementary (Mac OS like layout) and LXLE (traditional Linux layout). I also makes some UI changes and replaced some software with their modern counterpart.

Verions 1.1 will be out soon, but if you can not wait you can download version 1.0 [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flickos/files/flick-layout-switcher.deb/download). You can also download [layout-switcher.deb](https://sourceforge.net/projects/flickos/files/flick-layout-switcher.deb/download) because it not yet built-in in version 1.0.
