Title: About Me

Hello my name is Dioscoro, and I am an introverted software developer with a passion for programming and micro-controllers.

As an introvert, I've always found solace in the world of technology. It allows me to express myself and connect with others in a way that feels comfortable and natural to me. From a young age, I was drawn to the world of programming and the power it held to create something from nothing.

Over the years, I've honed my skills as a software developer, working on projects that have challenged me and helped me grow as a programmer. I particularly enjoy working with micro-controllers, as I find the ability to create something that interacts with the physical world incredibly satisfying.

Outside of work, I am family-oriented and enjoy spending time with my loved ones. Whether it's cooking a meal together, going on a hike, or simply sitting around the living room chatting, I value the time I spend with my family and the bonds we've created.

I may not be the most outgoing person, but I am passionate about what I do and committed to delivering high-quality work. If you're interested in learning more about me or working together on a project, feel free to get in touch!
