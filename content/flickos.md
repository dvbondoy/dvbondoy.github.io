Hello everyone. Do you have old computers and laptops at home that you can't use because they are too slow for today's demanding computing? Give them another life with FlickOS and help save the world by reducing pollution. FlickOS is designed from the ground up to be lightweight to the core but still looks good and elegant on its surface. It only uses  300MB of system memory and 0-1% of the processor on idle mode, so you can use your system resources to run your applications without lags and delays. See screenshots below for the current progress of FlickOS.
